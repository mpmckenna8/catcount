# catcount

Cat Counter made for https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud989/l-3417188540/m-3438178949


Each commit should be something like a different lesson from the course.  So if you want to see how it
looked at previous steps just look at the commit history.

After they started wanting a list which changed the page when clicked I decided to
use some d3 to stop me from making a bunch of code.  Though I kept some of it kind of spread out
to show what I was doing.


The cat images come from those provided in the instructions for this course and me.
Plus the ascii cat is from a repo with a ton of cat images in case you ever need some.
I think they're all even geotaged if you wanna map em.

no way it's working
